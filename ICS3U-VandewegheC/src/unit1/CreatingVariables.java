	Variables
	- A variable is a place in memory that you can tell your computer to set aside when you make a program.
	- This location can be used to store a piece of information.
	- You can give this location a name
	- You can change the information that the location holds.
	- You can recall the value of this memory location later and use in different parts of your program

	A variable be:

	ie.
	int myNum; //you are declaring a variable called myNum that stores an int type of data

		 *initialized*(Necessary) - in order to use the variable, you first need to give it an initial value. Otherwise, the computer won't be able to do something with the variable

	myNum = 10; //initializes the value of myNum to 10, so I can use it in other ways

		 *assigned* - similar to initialize, that you're setting the value of the variable to another value

	myNum = 20; //I've changed the value of myNum

	Once your variable has been given a value, it can then be *referenced* - that is, it can be used by its name
