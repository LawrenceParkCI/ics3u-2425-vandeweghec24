		/*
    Methods help you modularize a program by separating its tasks into self-contained units.

    Pros:
    - Written only once – no repeated code
    - Methods can be reused (invoked, called) from several locations in a program
    - Divide and conquer approach - Constructing programs from small, simple pieces
    - Software reusability - Use existing methods/classes as building blocks to create new programs.
    - Dividing a program into meaningful methods/classes makes the program easier to debug and maintain.

  Part 2 - Parts of a method
  a) You notice the javadac comment above the method - this explains what the method is doing, if it has any input, and if it has any output
  b) public -> means this method is useable anywhere
  c) static -> means this method acts like a function - there are no "things" using the method
  d) int -> the value that is gotten as a result of the method; the *return value*
  e) doubleNumber -> the name of the method; how we will be able to use it in the code
  f)int num -> the values we need in order for the method to work, and what we will call it in the method; the *parameter*
      the *parameter* -> what the name of the variable which will hold the value is
      the *argument* -> the actual value that is passed into the method
